## Welcome to Kiwi's Self-Driving Kiwibot Simulator

This simulator provides students with a real challenge of being a self driving engineer at Kiwi data science division.

### Objectives

(TODO: Rexplain the new menu) Two tracks (easy track and dangerous curves track) are provided to get your started on using machine learning algorithms and get a feeling of the API.

Your objective is to provide a solution, using your knowlege adquired during the curse, to put a kiwibot on fully autonomous service, i.e prove a kiwibot with a method of running the streets without crashing and make a route of getting from point A to point B.

### Available Game Builds (Precompiled builds of the simulator)

Instructions: Download the zip file, extract it and run (see How to Run) the execution file.

### **Releases on** [Link](https://github.com/Davidnet/kiwix/releases)

### How to run

#### Linux

In [Linux](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/bye6EruQtz/) the zip file contains two [ELF files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) that for security reasons are not marked to be executable. To give a file a executable flag the procedure is

```bash
$ chmod a+x file
```
A short summary of `chmod` can be found on the man pages using `man chmod` or on the [web](https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=chmod+a%2Bx+file).
Be sure to choose the corresponding architecture of your OS.

| File   | Recommended Architecture |
| ----   |:------------------------:|
| x86    | 32 Bit OS                |
| x86-64 | 64 Bit OS                |

After giving the executable bits to the file, recall that for executing the file, use
```bash
$ ./file
```


#### Mac

In [Mac](https://unitycloud-build-user-svc-live-build.s3.amazonaws.com/4672967344170/820117d8-a298-419d-a5f1-a0b9efb7eff9/default-mac-desktop-universal-33/Default%20Mac%20desktop%20Universal.zip?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI6ZGSQWNDMF7X33A&Expires=1501091431&Signature=dN%2Fs0gKhB8DjpMxYZTCrCIKtTxs%3D&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dkiwicampus-kiwibot-simulation-default-mac-desktop-universal-33.zip&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream) a single app package is provided, is independent of the architecture. Any problem, please submit a issue report to this repository.

#### Windows

In [Windows](https://unitycloud-build-user-svc-live-build.s3.amazonaws.com/4672967344170/820117d8-a298-419d-a5f1-a0b9efb7eff9/default-windows-desktop-64-bit-35/Default%20Windows%20desktop%2064-bit.zip?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI6ZGSQWNDMF7X33A&Expires=1501091629&Signature=FOmUcExdYSsPaxrcKOXdUHI2n%2B4%3D&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dkiwicampus-kiwibot-simulation-default-windows-desktop-64-bit-35.zip&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream) only a 64 bit version is provided, if you are interested on a 32 build, please open an issue on the issue tracker.

### General Recommendations

Is recommendable that if you don't have a GPU available on your system, please run the unity executable on low settings.

### General Controls

You can use any joystick supported by your OS, in the keyboard the following controls are provided (standard wasd mapping):

| keyboard   | Action |
| ----   |:------------------------:|
| wasd  | Control motion             |
| Space  | Break                |
| ESC    | Open close main menu |
|  C     | Change camera |
|  R     | Start recording |
|  P     | Begin AutoPilot connection |

### AutoPilot Communication

As you can observe in the communication tab, you can select a port, IP address to send images at a customizable size. A server script (TODO) is provided to give you a sketch to work on.

The program is accepting the following format (example in python provided):

```python
'{ "steering" : "%f", "throttle" : "%f" }' % (steering, throttle)
```

The possible values are on the range:

| Value   | Range |
| ----   |:------------------------:|
| Steering   |  {-1,1}                |
| throttle  | {-1,1}                |




# Conda Kiwi Enviroment

Conda is a package manager application that quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda is also an environment manager application. A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages


We suggest (not a requirement) to use the following conda environments so you can start as soon as possible to build your own AutoPilot on python.


### Linux (ONLY CPU)

```
$ conda env create -f environment_linux_nogpu.yml
```
Main packages provided: Tensorflow with GPU support, Keras and OpenCV.


### Linux (GPU with CUDA ENABLED)

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment_linux_gpu.yml
```

Main packages provided: Tensorflow with GPU support, Keras and OpenCV.


# Kiwi Auto Pilot

The Kiwi Auto Pilot is a minimalist project completely based on  a strip down version of [Donkey](https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey)
written by night-selfdriver [Will Roscoe](https://github.com/wroscoe)

A server.py and NeuronalNetwork.py is provided to give you a mock up to guide you.
